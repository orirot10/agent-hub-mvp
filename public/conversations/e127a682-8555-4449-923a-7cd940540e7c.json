    "content": "As a Behavioral Economist, I will focus on the economic and social behaviors of Burundi. Burundi is a small, landlocked country located in East Africa. Its economy is primarily based on agriculture, which accounts for approximately 40% of GDP and employs more than 90% of the population. It is one of the poorest countries in the world with a high poverty rate and has been affected by corruption, poor access to education, and the effects of civil conflicts. The economic growth is slow and not enough to significantly improve living standards.\n\nTrust-building Onboarding Plan:\n1. Step 1: Welcome and Introduction - Provide a warm welcome to new users with clear information about the platform and its benefits. Offer an overview of how the tool can help improve their economic situation based on the specific needs of the Burundian market.\n2. Step 2: Guided Tour - Provide a step-by-step guide of the tool interface, highlighting key features and functionalities. Use video tutorials or animations to make this engaging and easy to understand.\n3. Step 3: Support and Guidance - Establish a robust support system where users can seek help or ask questions. This can be in the form of a chatbot, an FAQ section, or a customer service line.\n4. Step 4: Feedback and Improvement - Request feedback from users about their experience with the tool, and use this information to make necessary adjustments and improvements. This shows users that their opinion is valued and builds trust.\n\nTool Interface Adjustments:\n1. Simplify the interface - Given the lower levels of education and digital literacy in Burundi, the tool should be simple and intuitive to use.\n2. Local language support - To increase adoption, the tool should support Kirundi, the official language of Burundi.\n3. Offline functionality - Considering the potential issues with internet connectivity in Burundi, the tool should have functionalities that can work offline.\n4. Mobile-friendly - Given the increase in mobile phone usage in Burundi, the tool should be mobile-friendly to increase its adoption.",
